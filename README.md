Welcome to the mobile menu example!

This code is meant to be read and understood along with the comments, so make sure you take your time reading it!

Remember, this is not a feature that CSS was ever really 'meant' to handle. Because of this, we need to resort to some pretty hacky and ugly thigs code-wise. When we learn JS, we will see that we don't actually need to add extra HTML & CSS to make this happen.

The pattern used in this example can by applied to more than just a menu showing up when something is clicked!
This pattern can be used to trigger any kind of change when something is clicked. Those changes could be changing the content on the page, switching an image from small to large, etc.
