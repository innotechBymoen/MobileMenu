    <!-- All of the HTML magic happens inside of here. You can choose to have a different desktop menu / header but in modern
    times you will find that many sites actually leave their mobile header as their desktop header. 

    One very important thing about this header is that the order of the contents inside matters!
    The radio buttons must be the oldest siblings, followed by the normal header images, followed by the section
    that contains the actual menu. These tags being siblings is what makes this whole thing work! -->
    <header id="mobile_header">
        <!-- These are radio buttons, usually used in forms when you have to choose 1 option out of many. 
            We use these to allow us to have one button that opens the menu, and one that closes the menu.
            In reality, these radio buttons don't actually show on the page, as we don't want to see them! -->
        <input type="radio" name="menu" id="menu_open" class="menu_radio_button">
        <input type="radio" name="menu" id="menu_close" class="menu_radio_button">

        <!-- Here we have standard header content, two images. 
            The only difference is the label wrapped around the second image, 
            which is designed to activate the menu_open button when clicked on -->
        <img src="/images/logo.svg" alt="Hamburger, French Fries and Hot Dog">
        <!-- The label is not a visable HTML element, but instead adds functionality when used correctly.
        The for attribute ties the label to the input with the same ID, so this label is tied to the
        input with the id of menu_open. When you click the image, you are really 'selecting' the menu_open input. -->
        <label for="menu_open">
            <!-- The class of hoverable on the image is just to give some animations when the image is hovered -->

        </label>

        <!-- This part is actually pretty simple, it is the menu that shows up when the open button is clicked. 
            We build it here assuming the display will be turned off by default, which it will be.
            In reality, it is just a normal section with content.-->

                Meaning when it is clicked, the menu will close if we use CSS correctly -->
